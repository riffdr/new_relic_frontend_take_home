  <!-- I could have gone for using customEvents to communicate between label.nr-view-switcher and div.nr-host-container,
  but I wanted to use this to display my awareness that style changes based on user state interactions (click, hover... ) can
  be captured and fully executed with CSS, hence why this <input> element at the top of the document body.

    <!-- Why this import map and shim:
     1. Provided data is static and large (2.5MB), and it was stated that it was not to be served from any kind of server
     2. JS module requests are far more efficient to pass static data rather than with an Ajax request call
     3. Since it is not an AJAX call but rather a request to the FileSystem, it gets cached automatically via HTTP2
     4. Es-module-shims version provides polyfill support (Safari does not support import maps)
